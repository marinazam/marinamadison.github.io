									<h1>Planning Mars Rover Mission with ArcMap</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Project_Mars/Map.jpg" alt="Mars South Pole" /></div>
								<p>The main goal of the Mars to create our ArcGIS Project to automate the process of programming rover’s trajectory of motion 
									on the Martian surface. We plan to use our GIS projects to establish the best rover’s rote for each site candidate. This project id a part of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gis">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialization</a> 
									taught by UC Davis through Coursera.</p>
								<p><h3>Image Source</h3></p>
								<p><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25996/mars-express-views-red-planets-south-pole/">ESA’s Mars Express 
									image of Mars South Poole area</a> of on Dec. 17, 2012, in Infrared, Green and Blue bands, using its 
									High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRST) .</p>
                                <p><h3>Research process</h3></p>
								<p>The image was added to the map document. The original image is too big to work with. We created a rectangle 
									shape file by Draw Tool and clipped an area around a South Pole. It is our point 
									of the interest on the Mars surface.</p>
								<p>The rovers cannot “jumps” оr climb steps. It is their constructive features which should be taken into 
									account while mapping their potential way on the Mars surface. This is an important limitation because the 
									Mars surface is covered by craters and hills. The rover path should be as flat as possible. Therefore, 
									we are going to design a ModelBuilder based on the water streams idea (Hydrology Tools) to create a flat rover path from 
									the starting point to the highest point of the Polar Cup. As a result, we get a model of the Mars surface
									 covered by a net of connected lines. We are able to select one of the paths manually accordingly
									  to our scientific goal.</p>
								<img src="image main"><img src="Project_Mars/ModelBuilder.jpg" alt="ModelBuilder" width="600" height="250">
								<p>At first, the layer was filled to reduce small imperfections in the data. After that, a raster of flow direction 
									from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbor from that filled DEM was created (Output Flow Direction raster in the ModelBulder.
									 And then we created the flow accumulation raster. To select the south faced slopes of the hills we accumulated flow into each sell, created raster linear
									  network between intersections. Finally, the Stream to Feature Tool helped us create a feature representing
									   the linear network.</p>
								<p> If we marked two layers on the map (Mars South Pole layer and Stream layer) we see that the Mars surface covered by a net of a number 
									 connected lines (similar to stream flow). We are able to select one of the paths manually accordingly to our scientific goal. 
									 We want to reach the pure iced area (the whitest color) on the top of the pole. It can be done right now but
									  postponed for a future because the float slope road is not the only prerequisition of the best choice. 
									  The other two are south facing and low slopes.</p>
								<p>The Slope Tool was used to create a map for slops. The Symbology of the layer Slope was reclassified. The three
									 green colors show the possible slope angles (up to 44 degree) which are welcome to rover. The red colors show 
									 the dangerous areas accordingly.</p>
                                <p>The Aspect Tool identifies the downslope direction of the maximum rate of change in value from each cell to its
									 neighbors. It can be thought of as the slope direction. The Raster calculator helped to choose the areas with
									  south facing accordingly to the <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/how-aspect-works.html">Tool guidance</a> .</p>
								<p>The rover uses a solar panel as a power source. Therefore, we received the Slope_south layer. The yellow color
									 on the map shows the sun areas, the other part of the map set as Hollow for best view. Here we should note
									  that we assume that Aspect Tool works on Mars the same way as on Earth. </p>
								<p>We could have combined Slope and Slope_south layers but decided to leave them separately. It is better for
									 analytical reasoning having as many information as possible.</p>
								<p>Metadata in ArcMap was added in order to make our data reusable.</p>
								<p><h3>Results</h3></p>
								<p>	 The map for the best rover path on the Martian surface was created and presented at the top of the page.
									  The Legend shows details of the map. The green colors display the slope angles (lower than 44 degrees, 
									  inclusive) which are safe for the rover to embark on. The red colors show the dangerous areas 
									  (over than 45 degrees accordingly). The yellow color represents 
									the sun faced areas where the rover's solar panels will work most effectively. The blue line is the 
									flat rover's path from the foothills to the Mars South Pole.</p>
